### The only good Minesweeper Android App

__Demo:__

### What's different about it?
The controls! as if you were playing on your computer with only right clicks:
- Every tap on a hidden block flags it
- Every tap on a number reveals all its neighbors - **if they are properly flagged**
- Holding a hidden block always reveals it
